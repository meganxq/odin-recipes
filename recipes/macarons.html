    <p>A recipe for the most delicious macarons you will ever try!</p>

Ingredients
<ul>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Almond flour</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Egg whites</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


Steps
<ol>
    <li>First, weigh out all of your ingredients. Next, sift together your almond flour and powdered sugar in a large bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add your egg whites to the bowl of your mixer and start mixing on a medium speed until they get frothy. Add in the salt.
        Gradually add in your sugar to the egg whites and mix on a medium speed until you get a soft peak consistency.</li>
    <li>After the egg whites are the right consistency, add about 1/3 of the dry mixture to the egg whites and fold in until there are no dry spots left.
        Add in the remaining dry mixture to the meringue and fold in until there are no dry spots. Begin to check for the “ribbon” stage, where the batter falls off in ribbons and you can make a figure 8 without it breaking off. Once you get to this consistency stop folding.</li>
    <li>Separate about 1/3 cup of the batter and place into a small bowl. Then add black food coloring, a little at a time, and blend well until desired shade is reached. Place into a piping bag with a small round tip.
        Place the remaining batter into a pastry bag with a medium round tip. Place your bag in a large cup to make it easier to add your batter.</li>
    <li>Place the macaron template under a silicon mat on a baking sheet.
        Hold your piping bag completely vertical when piping and lift straight up. In making the circles, try not to pipe out the batter pass or outside the line of the template.
        Using the black batter, pipe the panda face details: eyes, nose, ears, and feet on the macarons.</li>
    <li>After you have piped all the batter, bang the baking sheet on the counter 10-20 times (seriously) to remove all air bubbles. Use a toothpick or something sharp to pop them.
        Now it is time to let them dry. Leave them sitting on the counter for 30-60 minutes until you can touch them and you can feel a “shell” form over them. No batter should come off on your finger.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 300 degrees F. and bake your macarons for 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned. When you touch the top of the macaron it should not wiggle around on the “feet”.
        Allow them to cool COMPLETELY before taking them off the baking sheet.</li>
    </ol>
